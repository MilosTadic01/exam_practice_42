Write a program that will read a set of city coordinates under the form '%f, %f\n' from the stdint and will print the length of the shortest possible path containing all these cities under the form %.2f

Your program should work like this:

$ cat square.txt

0.0, 0.0
0.0, 1.0
1.0, 0.0
1.0, 1.0

$ ./tsp < square.txt | cat -e
4.00$

We will not test your program with more than 11 cities.

Allowed functions:
write, sqrtf, getline, fseek, fscanf, ferror, feof, fabsf, memcpy, fprintf, fclose, malloc, calloc, realloc, free, fopen, errno, stderr, stdin, stdout
